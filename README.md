## iAdvize test

This is a test app for iAdvize. It was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

My goal here is to provide a quick local chat app with minimal dependencies. It uses :

- React 16.5.2
- React built-in Context for state management (because that's what the cool kids do, and we don't need the Redux overhead)
- No testing
- Styled-components for styling (JS all the way !)
- No Service Worker, manifest.json, favicon, etc.
- Deployed on https://iadvize.bonnemaison.io
